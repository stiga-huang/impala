# This script measures the performance of a query, or a sequence of queries.
# It visualizes the stack traces on a flame graph
# (https://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html).
#
# It uses 'perf' and measures all processes in the system while the query
# is executing, not just Impala.
#
# PREREQUISITIES:
# * In directory ${IMPALA_TOOLCHAIN}: git clone https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph
# * Install 'perf' on your system (e.g. 'apt install linux-tools-generic')
#
# Usage:
# perf-query.sh "<query>"
# E.g.:
# perf-query.sh "select count(*) from tpch.lineitem group by l_returnflag"
# perf-query.sh "set MT_DOP=10; select count(*) from tpch.lineitem group by l_returnflag"
#
# Possible problems:
# Sometimes 'perf record -g' is not able to correctly identify all the stack frames, hence
# we cannot collapse everything together. Instead of '-g' we can use '--call-graph dwarf'
# which does a better job, but later 'perf script' takes much longer time for
# postprocessing the data. Interestingly 'perf-record.sh' doesn't seem to have this
# problem.

This directory contains Impala test data sets. The directory layout is structured as follows:

datasets/
   <data set>/<data set>_schema_template.sql
   <data set>/<data files SF1>/data files
   <data set>/<data files SF2>/data files

Where SF is the scale factor controlling data size. This allows for scaling the same schema to
different sizes based on the target test environment.

The schema template SQL files have the following format:

  The goal is to provide a single place to define a table + data files
  and have the schema and data load statements generated for each combination of file
  format, compression, etc. The way this works is by specifying how to create a
  'base table'. The base table can be used to generate tables in other file formats
  by performing the defined INSERT / SELECT INTO statement. Each new table using the
  file format/compression combination needs to have a unique name, so all the
  statements are pameterized on table name.
  The template file is read in by the 'generate_schema_statements.py' script to
  to generate all the schema for the Imapla benchmark tests.

  Each table is defined as a new section in the file with the following format:
  ====
  --- DATASET <- Start new section
  Data set name - Used to group sets of tables together
  ---- <- End sub-section
  Base table name
  ---- <- End sub-section
  CREATE TABLE statement - Statement to drop and create a table
  ---- <- End sub-section
  INSERT/SELECT * - The INSERT/SELECT * command for loading from the base table
  ---- <- End sub-section
  Parquet loading code executed by bash.
  ---- <- End sub-section
  LOAD from LOCAL - How to load data for the the base table
  ---- <- End sub-section
  ANALYZE TABLE ... COMPUTE STATISTICS - Compute statistics statement for table
